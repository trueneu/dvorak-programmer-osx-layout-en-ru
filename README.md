truedv keyboard layouts

Created with Ukelele (http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=ukelele).
Based on another layout for programmers that's, in turn, based on Dvorak.

Russian variant should be explained a bit. The standard "ЙЦУКЕН" layout is not changed, however when you press Cmd modifier key, it switches to Dvorak (so the copy shortcut, which is Cmd+C, transforms to Cmd+Ш with Russian layout).
Also tilde/backtick and equals/plus keys are remapped in Russian variant to colon/semicolon and hyphen/underscore, accordingly.

Nobody but me uses it anyway.
