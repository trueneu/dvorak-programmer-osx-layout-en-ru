Programmer Dvorak keyboard layouts 
Official site of the layout: http://www.kaufmann.no/roland/dvorak/

Since there is no Dvorak Programmer keyboard layouts in OSX by default, I've created one by myself with Ukelele (http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=ukelele).
Russian variant should be explained a bit. The standard "ЙЦУКЕН" layout is not changed, however when you press Cmd modifier key, it switches to Dvorak (so the copy shortcut, which is Cmd+C, transforms to Cmd+Ш with Russian layout).
Here you can find 2 variants of Russian with Dvorak Shortcuts - with modified (Dvorak Programmer) and not modified (Dvorak Simplified) number key row.

There may be some updates because I myself switched to Dvorak Programmer rather recently, thus I could miss some details, especially regarding the modifier keys interaction.

Enjoy!
